  h2.hih-title How I help Startups

  .hih-intro
    p I specialise in not having a specialty. I've never formally followed just one aspect of technology. Instead, I see making great software as a craft. 
    p My goal is to make software that people actually want to use. 
    p Because of my approach, startups usually hire me instead of a team to help them get a product off the ground or to prototype an idea they want to test.
