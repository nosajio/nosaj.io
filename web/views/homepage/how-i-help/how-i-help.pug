    h1.section-title.hih-title How I help Startups
    p I specialise in not having a specialty. I've never formally followed just one aspect of technology. Instead, I see making great software as a craft. 
    p My goal is to make great software that people actually want to use. 
    p It's because of this approach that startups usually hire me instead of a team to help them get a product off the ground, or to quickly prototype an idea that they want to validate.
